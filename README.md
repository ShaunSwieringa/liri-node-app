# Work-In-Progress: Liri-Node-App

I am currently working on the liri bot homework assignment. I have been having some difficulties with it and haven't gotten it working yet. I will be continuing to learn and improve this project until it is fully functional.

## APIs being used

I will be using the spotify, OMDB, BandsInTown, and Concert-This APIs.

## About the Project

When functional it will be a Siri like app that is text based in the Git Bash console. It will be linked with OMDB, BandsInTown, Spotify, and Concert-This. It will take the users input whether it be a movie title, Song etc. search the apis and respond with the information related to that search. It will display it in an easy to read format and you can search again.

## Visuals

I will upload pictures/videos once I have it up and running.

## Usage

It will be a fun, easy to use, and useful little tool that can get you a wide assortment of information. Whether it be upcoming concert info, movie and actor info or you really want to look up that song stuck in your head in hopes of making it stop.

## Roadmap

I dont currently have a roadmap in place on this project. I will need to study up these next few days and hopefully add the final elements needed for a complete project.
